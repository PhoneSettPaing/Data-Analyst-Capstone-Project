# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## Project Overview

As part of the capstone project, you will take on the role of a Data Analyst with a global IT and Business Services firm. In this role, you will be analyzing several datasets to help identify trends for emerging technologies. 

The Capstone project is divided into 6 Modules:
* In Module 1 you will collect data for the technology skills that are in demand from various sources including: Job postings, blog posts, surveys.
* In Module 2, you will take the collected data and prepare it for analysis by using data wrangling techniques like: Finding duplicates, removing duplicates, finding missing values, and inputting missing values.
* You’ll continue to module 3 and apply statistical techniques to analyze the data and identify insights and trends like: What are the top programming languages that are in demand? What are the top database skills that are in demand? What are the most popular IDEs? And Demographic data like gender and age distribution of developers.
* In module 4, you’ll focus on choosing an appropriate visualization based on the data you want to present using charts, plots, and histograms to help reveal your findings and trends.
* In module 5, you will employ Cognos to create interactive dashboards to help you analyze and present the data dynamically.
* In the final module, you will use your storytelling skills to provide a narrative and present the findings of your analysis. 

## Process:

You have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants. In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, your organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements. 
As a Data Analyst, you will be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills. 

Your first task is to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including:
* Job postings
* Training portals
* Surveys

Once you have collected enough data, you will begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends that may include the following:
* What are the top programming languages in demand?
* What are the top database skills in demand?
* What are the popular IDEs?

You will begin by scraping internet web sites and accessing APIs to collect data in various formats like .csv files, excel sheets, and databases. Once this is completed, you will make that data ready for analysis using data wrangling techniques. When the data is ready you will then want to apply statistical techniques to analyze the data. Then bring all of your information together by using IBM Cognos Analytics to create your dashboard. And finally, show off your storytelling skills by sharing your findings in a presentation.
